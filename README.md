A simple Java Swing application that checks whether a given year is a leap year.  
This project demonstrates basic GUI development, event-driven programming, and conditional logic.  
Originally built as part of an introductory Java course.

## 🧠 Leap Year Logic

A year is considered a leap year if:

1. It is divisible by **4**, **and**  
2. Not divisible by **100**, **unless**  
3. It is also divisible by **400**

The program implements this logic correctly using nested conditional checks.
